# Symbitech Open Source Quiz

Welcome to the Symbitech Open Source Quiz! This repository contains problems designed to test your knowledge in python programming and problem solving. The problems are divided into three difficulty levels: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**.

## Problem Difficulty and Points Distribution

There are three difficulty levels in the quiz:

### 1. Easy
- **Points**: 20 points

### 2. Medium
- **Points**: 35 points

### 3. Hard
- **Points**: 50 points

## Rules for Switching Difficulty

- **Switching from Hard to Easy or Medium**:  
  If you decide to switch from **Hard** to **Medium** or **Easy**, you will **lose 20 points** for switching to Medium or **lose 30 points** if you switch to Easy.

- **Switching from Medium to Easy**:  
  If you decide to switch from **Medium** to **Easy**, you will **lose 10 points**.

Points are earned based on the difficulty you choose, and switching down in difficulty reduces the points you can earn.
